description: Non-obvious setup required for Playwright Chromium browser evidence in this Nix-based workspace
---

Playwright’s bundled Chromium may fail to start here because `libgbm.so.1` is
absent from the standard runtime path. The existing viewport-QA setup compiles
the harmless headless stub and sets the library path; browser-based scripts
should invoke that setup before importing Playwright.

**Why:** Importing Playwright before the environment setup can capture the
incomplete runtime environment, producing a misleading “browser closed” error
even though the shared setup succeeds.

**How to apply:** Reuse the viewport runner’s setup in browser QA scripts, and
keep the real screen-reader limitation separate from accessibility-tree
observations.

The Chromium helper only supplies the local `libgbm.so.1` workaround. Firefox
and WebKit also require their Playwright system dependencies; the full matrix
is expected to run in CI after `playwright install --with-deps chromium firefox
webkit`. In this Nix workspace those engines may be present but not launchable.

**Why:** A local full-matrix failure can be a missing host-library condition,
not a browser assertion or site regression.

**How to apply:** Keep the runner’s missing-engine error explicit, use
`--static-only` only for fast local checks, and rely on the CI job for the
three-engine release evidence.

The focused FoundRy accessibility check is a separate Node Playwright gate; the
existing Python Playwright installation does not satisfy its Node module or
browser-revision dependency.

**Why:** Treating the two language runtimes as interchangeable previously made
the focused evidence appear unavailable locally instead of exposing a setup
requirement.

**How to apply:** Keep the Node package and Chromium install explicit in the
supported npm/CI command, while leaving the Python browser gates on their own
pinned dependency boundary.

At the 768px compact-navigation boundary, measure visible menu links separately
from the transformed navigation container's bounding box. In Chromium, the
closed container can intersect the viewport while no menu links do, and an
opening link can enter the viewport before the CSS transform finishes.

**Why:** A container-only visibility assertion can report a false failure for
an empty or covered portion of the panel, while checking immediately after the
first link appears can mistake an in-progress transition for the open state.

**How to apply:** Wait for the navigation transform to settle, then check link
visibility, `aria-hidden`/`inert`, and Escape focus restoration independently
from the panel's geometry.
