# Agent Guidelines: Glee-fully Tools

This file is the operating constitution for any AI agent working in this repo.
Read it before touching any file. It applies equally to Replit Agent, Copilot,
Claude, and any other AI assistant.

Cross-reference `replit.md` for site-specific architecture, script inventory,
and current audit state. Cross-reference `.agents/agent-skills.md` for site-specific
governance (CSS scope map, script run-order, taxonomy rules, Mermaid referral
invariant).

- Work in small steps. Ask before large refactors.
- Prefer adding tests before changing logic if risk is medium/high.
- Keep changes localized. Avoid touching unrelated files.
- If you need config/secrets, stop and ask. Never invent credentials.
- Summarize what you changed and why at the end.

## Verified repository context (2026-09-04)

This section records the current project understanding from repository evidence.
Update it when the structure, runtime, deployment model, or validation baseline
changes. Historical audit notes elsewhere in the repository retain their original
dates and counts.

### Target and scope

- The target is one Git repository at `/Volumes/OKH-Local/04_GitHub_Mirrors/Glee-fullyTools`.
- No nested Git repositories or separate application roots were found.
- This guide is canonical for agent behavior. `CLAUDE.md` points here. `replit.md`
  and `.agents/agent-skills.md` provide site-specific implementation notes and skills.

### Understanding

- **Confirmed purpose:** This is the public hub for a suite of personalizable
  Custom GPT tools. Visitors browse a seven-branch Toolbox, read tool-ette
  descriptions, and follow links to the corresponding GPT experiences.
- **Confirmed user value:** The homepage, README, and Showcase position the suite
  as a warm, approachable way to use domain-specific AI for everyday life, work,
  planning, and personal organization.
- **Current vision and boundary:** Grow a warm, structured public catalog and
  routing hub while preserving one shared design language, the
  trunk-to-branch-to-tool-ette taxonomy, and a coherent visitor path. The public
  hub does not certify the behavior or availability of externally hosted GPTs.
- **Current status:** The site is implemented and deployable as a static website
  in the **active platform transition** phase. It has 62 indexable public
  pages, 7 branch hubs, and 42 Tool-ettes; publication states and the meaning of
  complete are authoritative in `docs/suite-promise.md`.

### Architecture and entry points

- Production content is 65 validator-scoped HTML files: the homepage,
  supporting pages, the Toolbox hub, seven branch pages, 42 tool-ette pages,
  and the site's utility/fallback pages. HTML under `assets/`
  and `.agents/` is development or agent content and is excluded by site tools.
- `assets/css/theme.css` is the shared stylesheet. `assets/js/app.js` provides
  shared browser behavior, including navigation, search, theme handling, and
  reading progress. `mermaid-init.js` is loaded only for the two Mermaid pages.
- Python scripts under `scripts/` maintain pages, indexes, feeds, icons, and QA
  reports. Site content has no framework or application build step.
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json` exist for optional local Lighthouse and
  Puppeteer tooling. They do not define the website runtime or a bundling step.
- Local development uses `python3 scripts/serve-site.py`, which serves port 5000 with
  no-cache headers. `.replit` uses the same port and deploys the repository root
  as a static site. `CNAME` identifies `glee-fully.tools` as the site origin.
- GitHub Actions runs the Python validation workflow on pushes and pull requests
  to `main`. A separate workflow runs Playwright viewport QA on every push and pull
  request to `main`. It deliberately carries no path filter, because the check
  is required by branch protection and path filters would leave
  dependency-only pull requests permanently blocked.

The September 7, 2026 FoundRy feature-page addition brings the current tree to
64 production HTML files and 61 indexable pages. `/foundry/` introduces the
locally run builder with public source; it adds no public application runtime. Earlier dated
validation counts below remain historical.

The September 29, 2026 transition notice adds `/next-chapter/`, bringing the
current inventory to 65 public HTML files and 62 indexed pages. Run
`scripts/sync-transition-notices.py --check` after catalog changes. Its generated
blocks preserve launch links and publication states. Original GPT publication
labels do not establish replacement readiness.

### Verified validation baseline

The repository's latest recorded validation passed on 2026-08-29, re-run after
scoping the CSP `img-src` allowlist (see `scripts/csp.py`) and fixing the
dark-mode `theme-color` value (see `scripts/normalize-head.py`) -- both
confirmed clean at 63 production HTML pages, 0 issues, 0 warnings, 0 broken
links, 60 sitemap URLs. The current tree contains 65 production HTML files, 62
sitemap URLs, and 49 Atom feed entries. Re-run these commands after any content
or tooling change to establish a current baseline:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate-site.py
# Expected: 65 files; 0 issues; 0 warnings

python3 scripts/check-links.py
# Expected: 0 broken links and 0 sitemap mismatches; link totals vary by content
```

After HTML content changes, rebuild `assets/data/search-index.json` with
`python3 scripts/build-search-index.py`. Do not hand-edit generated JSON, feed,
or icon-map files. For responsive browser QA, use the workflow or the verified
Playwright runner documented in `replit.md`.

### Known gaps and open questions

- Several dated audit sections in `replit.md` describe earlier page counts and
  earlier CSS line counts. Treat those as historical records, not current state.
- The validator and link checker write reports with fixed 2026-05-03 filenames.
  This is an existing tooling convention and was not changed during this context
  pass.
- It is unknown whether the optional Lighthouse and Puppeteer package metadata is
  still actively maintained. Do not add or upgrade dependencies without owner
  approval.
- Do not infer Tool-ette availability from a passing HTML/link check. Use the
  publication register and state precedence in `docs/suite-promise.md`.

### Governance files added 2026-08-03

The following governance files were created during the 14-skill compliance pass:

- `LIFECYCLE.md` — repository lifecycle state (Active); update when state transitions
- `docs/adr/` — Architecture Decision Records for significant technical decisions;
  see `docs/adr/README.md` for the index. Add new ADRs here for framework, tooling,
  or security decisions.
- `brand-styles/` — Visual brand style registry (okhp3-brand-style-registry format);
  `brand-styles/profiles/glee-fully.yaml` is the active Glee-fully brand profile.
  Do not hand-edit the profile — use the brand-style-registry skill workflow instead.

> **AGENTS.md sync circuit** — This file is one of three kept in lockstep.
> Any structural edit to sections 1–5 must be propagated to the other two repos
> before the session closes. Section 2.2.1 (per-site inventory) is intentionally
> site-specific and does not need to match line-for-line.

## Repository Hygiene Standard
**Brand:** Glee-fully Tools (Coral / Cream)
**Body scope class:** `glee-main` (pages set `<body class="glee-main">`)
**Canonical stylesheet:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OKHP3/OverKill-Hill/main/assets/css/theme.css
**Version:** 2.3

This section governs how files and folders are named, what structure all sibling
repos share, what counts as detritus, and the brand contract this repo serves.
It exists because AI agents, left alone, will name files inconsistently across
sessions, scatter working artifacts into the repo root, and leave paste-buffer
transcripts in `attached_assets/`. A reader two months later cannot tell what is
real, what is stale, and what was junk from the start. The rules below stop that.

---

### 0. Language Standard: en-US

This project is authored, owned, and maintained by a United States-based creator.
All user-facing content must use United States English (`en-US`).

**Scope:** UI copy, documentation, README content, release notes, comments intended
for human readers, prompts, tooltips, button text, error messages, validation
messages, QA/QC reports, marketing language, and any new code identifiers
authored in this repo.

**Examples of required US-EN spellings:** color, behavior, organization, optimize,
customize, center, analyze, modeling, artifact, visualization, standardization,
initialize, finalize, prioritize, summarize, license (noun), program, catalog,
fulfill, gray, toward, among, while.

**Protected exceptions (do NOT change spelling in):**
- Direct quotations from external sources
- Proper nouns, brand names, product names
- Dependency, package, or library names
- URLs, file names, route names
- API fields, schema keys, existing code identifiers
- Generated lockfiles or external standards

**Identifier rule:** en-US applies to identifiers authored in *new* code.
Renaming *existing* identifiers (variables, functions, types, exported symbols)
is a breaking change and falls under the same renaming policy as files in
Section 1: update every importer in the same commit, run the build and tests
after, and set up a redirect if anything external depends on the old name. Do
not run a blanket find-and-replace across existing identifiers without explicit
instruction.

**Status:** US English compliance is a required QA/QC gate, not a stylistic
preference. Any output failing this standard is a defect.

---

### 1. Naming conventions

#### 1.1 Default: lowercase with hyphens (kebab-case)

Every file and folder name defaults to lowercase letters and digits, with words
separated by single hyphens. Use this for documentation, configuration, assets,
data files, CSS, plain scripts, and folder names.

Examples that are correct:
- `site-tokens.css`
- `design-system.md`
- `brand-conformance-checklist.md`
- `sync-skills.sh`
- `assets/img/brand-sigil.svg`
- `assets/docs/release-plan.md`
- `scripts/build-search-index.py`

Examples that are wrong and must be renamed when discovered:
- `SiteTokens.css` (PascalCase used for a stylesheet)
- `designSystem.md` (camelCase)
- `BrandConformanceChecklist.md` (PascalCase used for a doc)
- `My Document.md` (spaces)

The convention does not change with file extension. A markdown doc and a YAML
workflow and an SVG asset all follow the same rule.

#### 1.2 The full convention by file role

The rule is "kebab-case by default" with three structural exceptions, all
dictated by ecosystem convention rather than preference. The table below is the
complete decision; deviations from it require an explicit reason.

| File role | Convention | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Documentation (`.md`) | kebab-case | `design-system.md`, `release-plan.md` |
| Stylesheets (`.css`) | kebab-case | `theme.css`, `site-tokens.css` |
| YAML, JSON, TOML data and config | kebab-case | `sync-tokens.yml`, `palette-defaults.json` |
| Plain scripts (`.sh`, `.py`) | kebab-case | `sync-skills.sh`, `build-tokens.py` |
| Assets (SVG, PNG, WebP, etc.) | kebab-case | `brand-sigil.svg`, `og-cover.webp` |
| Folder names | kebab-case | `assets/img/`, `assets/docs/`, `scripts/` |
| Plain TypeScript modules (`.ts` not exporting a hook or component) | kebab-case | `theme-mode.ts`, `chat-store.ts` |
| React hooks (`.ts` exporting `useFoo`) | camelCase matching the hook | `useTheme.ts`, `useDebounce.ts` |
| React components (`.tsx`/`.jsx`) | PascalCase matching the component | `ChatPane.tsx`, `MessageList.tsx` |
| Root governance files | ALL CAPS (ecosystem convention) | `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `SKILL.md` |
| Tool-required filenames | Whatever the tool requires | `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `.gitignore`, `.replit`, `.npmrc`, `.prettierrc`, `Makefile`, `CNAME` |
| Web-standard files | Whatever the spec dictates | `humans.txt`, `robots.txt`, `llms.txt`, `404.html`, `_headers`, `favicon.ico`, `site.webmanifest` |

#### 1.3 The "why" behind the three structural exceptions

The three non-kebab cases (PascalCase components, camelCase hooks, ALL CAPS
governance) are not aesthetic choices. They are ecosystem signals.

- PascalCase `.tsx` matches the React component it exports, so the filename and
  the JSX tag read the same: `import Button from './Button'; <Button />`.
  Renaming it to kebab-case breaks tooling assumptions.
- camelCase `useTheme.ts` matches the hook function name. The convention is
  universal in the React ecosystem.
- ALL CAPS root files (LICENSE, README, etc.) trigger special rendering on
  GitHub and are recognized by virtually every tool that scans repos.
  Renaming them costs visibility.

Everything else is kebab-case because it is the most readable choice in URLs,
shell history, and `ls` output, and the broadly accepted default across modern
web ecosystems.

#### 1.4 Code identifiers are separate from filenames

These rules govern filenames and folder names only. Identifiers inside code
follow their language conventions: TypeScript uses `camelCase` for variables
and `PascalCase` for types; CSS custom properties use `--kebab-case`; Python
uses `snake_case`. Do not change identifiers when renaming files.

#### 1.5 Decision tree (when in doubt)

1. Is it a root governance file with a universally expected name (`README`,
   `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG`, etc.)? Keep the ALL CAPS conventional name.
2. Is it a tool-required filename (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, dotfile,
   etc.)? Use whatever the tool requires.
3. Is it a `.tsx`/`.jsx` exporting a React component? Use PascalCase matching
   the component.
4. Is it a `.ts` exporting a React hook (`useFoo`)? Use camelCase matching the
   hook.
5. Otherwise: kebab-case.

#### 1.6 Renaming policy

Renaming a file changes import paths and deployed URLs. When fixing a casing
violation:
- Update every importer in the same change.
- If the file is referenced by a deployed URL, add a redirect or keep a stub
  at the old path until traffic clears.
- Never rename without running the build and tests after.

### 2. Sibling repo structural standard

Every OverKill Hill P3 static site repo shares this top-level structure.
Existing siblings converge toward it; deviations are permitted only when
site-specific content genuinely requires a different layout.

```
Each site also has its own unique content directories (e.g. `toolbox/`,
`showcase/`, `ecosystem/`, `persona/` for Glee-fully Tools) that are not part
of the shared standard. Do not remove content directories that are unique to a site.

#### 2.1 Folders that must not exist at the repo root

These names are reserved for detritus (see Section 3) and must not be used
as legitimate folders: `_unused/`, `attached_assets/`, `attached-assets/`,
`_drafts/`, `_scratch/`, `_old/`, `tmp/`, `temp/`, `unused/`.

#### 2.2 Directory purposes and expected contents

The definitions below describe the purpose and expected contents of every
required shared folder. Use this as the placement guide when creating a new
file -- put it in the most specific folder that matches its type. Do not store
working artifacts here (see Section 3). Folders that are currently empty hold
a `.gitkeep` placeholder; remove it when the first real file is added.

---

**`assets/`**
Top-level container for all compiled, generated, and static front-end assets.
No files live directly in `assets/` itself. HTML pages live at the repo root
or in named content subdirectories. Tooling scripts belong in `scripts/`.

---

**`assets/audit/`**
Machine-generated QA and test-run JSON output worth keeping as a dated record.
Written automatically by the validator and QA scripts -- never hand-edited.

Expected file types and naming patterns:
- `validation-report-YYYY-MM-DD.json` -- `scripts/validate-site.py` output
- `links-report-YYYY-MM-DD.json` -- `scripts/check-links.py` output
- `asset-inventory-YYYY-MM-DD.json` -- `scripts/audit-assets.py` output
- `responsive-audit-YYYY-MM-DD.json` -- `scripts/responsive-audit.py` output
- `viewport-qa-YYYY-MM-DD.json` / `viewport-qa-full-YYYY-MM-DD.json` --
  `scripts/viewport-qa.py` / `scripts/run-viewport-qa.py` output
- `lighthouse-YYYY-MM-DD.json` -- Lighthouse CI output (if run)
- `accent-contrast-report.json` -- `scripts/check-accent-contrast.py` output
- `screenshots/` subdirectory -- Playwright failure captures (gitignored at root)

Human-authored audit reports belong in `assets/docs/`, not here.

---

**`assets/css/`**
Stylesheets only. One canonical file: `theme.css`. It is the shared stylesheet
that drives all three brand tiers (GLOBAL, OVERKILL, GLEE, ASKJAMIE) via
scoped selectors. The CSS Scope Map in `replit.md` documents which line ranges
belong to which scope.

- `theme.css` -- the only file that should normally live here
- `theme.css.bak-*` -- pre-reorg safety backups; delete after verifying the
  reorg succeeded (or gitignore them)

No JavaScript, no data files, no images. All filenames must be kebab-case.
Do not add component-level or page-specific CSS files -- extend `theme.css`.

---

**`assets/data/`**
Structured JSON (or YAML) data files consumed at runtime by front-end scripts
or at build time by maintenance scripts. All files here are auto-generated or
machine-maintained -- do not hand-edit files generated by a script.

Expected files:
- `search-index.json` -- rebuilt by `scripts/build-search-index.py`; powers
  the client-side search engine. Regenerate after any content change.
- `sparkle.json` -- single-source data for the "Today's Sparkle" banner;
  managed via `assets/data/sparkle.json`; loaded automatically by `assets/js/app.js` (present on sites that use
  the Sparkle feature).
- `icon-map.json` -- mapping of page/tool slugs to image paths; rebuilt by
  `scripts/audit-assets.py` (present on sites with a tool/GPT icon set).

Audit output and documentation do not belong here.

---

**`assets/downloads/`**
Files offered for direct download by site visitors -- PDFs, ZIPs, exportable
templates, printable guides, prompt protocols. Keep this minimal and intentional.

Expected file types: `.pdf`, `.zip`, `.md` (printable reference docs), `.csv`.
Naming convention: kebab-case with a version slug or date where relevant, e.g.
`okh-prompt-protocol-v1.md`, `brand-guide-2026.pdf`.

Use `.gitkeep` when empty. Remove it when the first real file is added.
Internal tooling assets, scripts, and site images do not belong here.

---

**`assets/docs/`**
Human-authored project documentation: audit reports, design records, planning
artifacts, cross-site sync guides, and theme/style reference documents. All
files here are Markdown (`.md`). Not crawled -- excluded from the search
indexer, validators, and `sitemap.xml` by every HTML-walking script.

Expected naming patterns:
- `audit-topic-YYYY-MM-DD.md` or `AUDIT-TOPIC-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (historical)
- `LIVE_SITE_EVALUATION_YYYY-MM-DD.md` -- full evaluation reports
- `OPEN_TODOS_YYYY-MM-DD.md` -- deferred work and known placeholders
- `og-image-requirements.md`, `image-usage-report.md` -- standing reference docs
- `sister-site-sync.md` -- cross-site sync constant map and checklist
- Theme guides: `gleefully-replit-theme-guide.md`, etc.

May contain sub-folders for organizing related documents (e.g., `sister-site-sync/`
for cross-site coordination files). Machine-generated JSON output belongs in
`assets/audit/`, not here. Superseded docs move to `docs/archive/`.

---

**`assets/img/`**
All site images served directly to browsers via HTML or CSS. Filenames must be
kebab-case with descriptive slugs and dimension/variant suffixes, e.g.
`brand-hero-wide-1536.png`, `sentinel-waiting-square-1024.png`.

Expected file types: PNG (source), WebP (if not yet moved to `assets/img/webp/`).
For hero images, encode orientation and width in the name:
`<brand>-<subject>-<orientation>-<width>.<ext>`

Sub-folders permitted directly under `assets/img/`:
- `favicons/` -- the complete favicon set (see below)
- `library/` -- reusable brand library and source variants (see below)
- `webp/` -- WebP pipeline output (see below)
- `og/` -- Open Graph card images (AskJamie convention; add to siblings as needed)
- `brandguard/` -- AI/design reference brand assets (AskJamie convention)
- `tool-ettes/` -- per-tool-ette hero images (Glee-fully only)
- `toolbox/` -- toolbox hub images (Glee-fully only)

Do not place favicon files, WebP output, or library variants directly in
`assets/img/` -- use the appropriate sub-folder.

---

**`assets/img/favicons/`**
The complete favicon set for the site. Generated once; rarely changed.
Referenced via `<link rel="icon">` tags in every page `<head>`.

Required minimum set:
- `favicon-16x16.png`, `favicon-32x32.png`, `favicon-48x48.png`
- `android-chrome-192x192.png`, `android-chrome-512x512.png`
- `apple-touch-icon.png`
- `favicon.png` (full-resolution source master)
- `favicon.svg` (vector master, if available)
- `favicon.ico` (legacy; may live at repo root instead)

Do not store nav-bar logos or hero images here.

---

**`assets/img/library/`**
Reusable brand image library: unused variants, alternate crops, source assets,
and color-variant images kept for reference or future use. Files here are not
necessarily referenced by any live page -- this is the on-disk brand archive
so assets are not permanently lost.

Expected file types: PNG source files and WebP counterparts, named in kebab-case
by subject and variant. Do not store WebP pipeline output here -- that belongs
in `assets/img/webp/`. Use `.gitkeep` when the library is empty.

---

**`assets/img/webp/`**
WebP-format output of the image conversion pipeline. Generated by
`scripts/convert-hero-webp.py`, `scripts/convert-gpt-icons-webp.py`,
`scripts/png-to-webp.py`, or `scripts/picture-upgrade.py`. Never hand-placed.

Expected file types: `.webp` only. Filenames mirror the source PNG with a
width or size suffix, e.g. `brand-hero-wide-768.webp`,
`gpt-icon-01-careers-retro-stripe-512.webp`. PNG source files stay in
`assets/img/`. Use `.gitkeep` when the pipeline has not yet been run.

---

**`assets/js/`**
JavaScript files served directly to browsers. No build step; files are served
as-is. No TypeScript, no bundled output. Node.js tooling belongs in `scripts/`.

Expected files:
- `app.js` -- the primary shared script: site search, nav toggle, GA4 analytics
  bootstrap, theme toggle, reading progress bar, scroll reveal, sticky TOC.
- `mermaid-init.js` -- Mermaid v12.0.0 ESM initializer; loaded only on pages that
  contain diagrams (`ecosystem/`, `universe/`).
- ~~`sparkle-loader.js`~~ -- **removed 2026-05-28**; logic merged into `app.js`.
  Banner content is now driven by `assets/data/sparkle.json` loaded at runtime by `app.js`.

Do not add vendor libraries here -- load from CDN per the static-only constraint.

---

**`assets/templates/`**
Structural HTML shell templates for scaffolding new pages. Development
artifacts only -- excluded from the search indexer, validators, and
`sitemap.xml` by every HTML-walking script.

Expected contents:
- `template--<page-type>.html` files, one per page type, using double-dash
  separator. Each carries a comment block listing every `[[TOKEN]]` before
  `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
- `INDEX.md` or `index.md` / `template-index.md` -- documents every template,
  its token list, and the workflow for creating new pages from it.
- `template-system-prompt.md` -- optional AI prompt document for using
  templates (AskJamie convention; adopt on siblings as needed).

Page types currently templated across the family:
homepage, hub, interior-single, tool/lens detail, error, holding/utility,
article, case study, mermaid-diagram, interior-form, project detail.

Finished published pages do not belong here. Images do not belong here.

---

**`docs/`**
Top-level cross-functional documentation directory rendered by GitHub as the
repo's documentation root. Intended for project-level documents that apply
across planning sessions or across multiple repos -- distinct from
`assets/docs/`, which holds per-site audit and evaluation reports.

Expected contents:
- Cross-site coordination docs: sync plans, dispatch notes, search design specs
- Sprint planning summaries and design decision records
- Integration research and tool evaluation documents
- `.gitkeep` placeholder when empty

Keep `docs/` for planning-level content. If a document is purely a site audit
report, it belongs in `assets/docs/` instead.

---

**`docs/archive/`**
Superseded documentation removed from active use but preserved for historical
context. Triage before adding -- if a document has no future reference value,
delete it rather than archiving it.

Expected contents:
- Completed sprint plans and summaries, prefixed `YYYY-MM-DD-`
- Superseded audit reports replaced by newer versions
- Design decision records for concluded decisions
- `.gitkeep` placeholder when empty

---

**`scripts/`**
Python (`.py`) and shell (`.sh`) maintenance, build, audit, and migration
scripts. Node.js QA runners (`.mjs`) also live here. All filenames must be
kebab-case. Scripts are run manually from the command line or invoked from
`post-merge.sh`; they are never served to browsers.

Script categories (last updated 2026-08-23; describes what each script does, by side-effect type). As of 2026-08-30, most of the scripts named below have moved to `scripts/archive/`; see `scripts/README.md` for which ones are still active in `scripts/` itself:

- **Validators / read-only** (exit non-zero on regressions; safe for CI):
  `validate-site.py`, `check-links.py`, `audit-assets.py`,
  `audit-site.py`, `audit-meta-versions.py`, `check-accent-contrast.py`,
  `check-glee-dark-coverage.py`, `check-mtb-version.py`,
  `responsive-audit.py`, `run-viewport-qa.py`,
  `viewport-qa.py`, `site-audit.py`, `sparkle-qa.py`,
  `check-public-headers.py`, `check-workflow-actions.py`, `check-csp.py`,
  `check-search-coverage.py`;
  `responsive-qa.mjs` (Node/Playwright read-only QA runner);
  `post-merge.sh` (integrity check and cache-version synchronization after merges; may update generated cache tokens)
- **Index / feed / report builders** (regenerate data or output files):
  `build-search-index.py`, `generate-sitemap.py`, and `generate-feed.py` are
  active deterministic release-artifact generators;
  `generate-illustrations.py`, `generate-templates.py`, `extract-templates.py`
  are archived reference tools.
- **Idempotent mutators** (safe to re-run; AUTOGEN-marker or presence-check-driven):
  `normalize-head.py`, `inject-jsonld.py`, `inject-breadcrumb.py`,
  `inject-color-scheme-init.py`, `inject-gpt-icon-picture.py`,
  `inject-hero-picture.py`, `inject-keep-exploring.py`,
  `inject-nav-logo-webp.py`, `inject-showcase-footer.py`,
  `inject-showcase-subnav.py`, `inject-toolette-hub.py`,
  `remove-deprecated-meta.py`, `enhance-pages.py`, `modernize-pages.py`,
  `apply-modern-baseline.py`, `reclassify-construction-banners.py`,
  `activate-icons.py`, `add-toolbox-to-footer.py`, `fix-image-performance.py`,
   `add-noreferrer.py`,
  `fix-audit-2026-05-12.py`, `fix-footer-nav-2026-07-20.py`,
  `fix-placeholder-gpt-links.py`, `reorg-theme-css.py`,
  `wire-illustrations.py`, `update-card-srcsets.py`,
  `update-placeholder-dimensions.py`, `picture-upgrade.py`,
  `rename-img-kebab.py`, `cache-bust.py`, `move-orphans-to-library.py`
- **Sync scripts** (read SVG/data sources and patch HTML; safe to re-run):
  `sync-css-version.py`, `sync-image-alt.py`, `sync-portfolio-stats.py`,
  `sync-sparkle-fallback.py`, `sync-social-card.py`
- **Image pipeline** (WebP conversion; skips existing output files):
  `png-to-webp.py`, `convert-hero-webp.py`, `convert-gpt-icons-webp.py`
- **Governance and generation**:
  `push-to-github.py`, `cross-site-sync.py`, `release-mtb.py`,
  `csp.py`, `generate-csp.py`
- **Local development**:
  `serve-site.py` - no-cache local static-site server for Replit and browser QA
- **Retired - exit 1; do not re-run** (one-shot mutators whose
  preconditions no longer hold; re-running would corrupt or double-inject):
  `inject-sparkle-loader.py` (sparkle-loader.js merged into app.js, 2026-05-28)

When adapting a script for a sibling repo, update these per-site constants:
`SITE` / `SITE_ORIGIN`, `GA4_ID`, `EXPECTED_THEME_COLOR`, any hardcoded
localStorage key, and any brand-specific image filename lists.
See `assets/docs/sister-site-sync.md` (AskJamie) for the full constant map.

Scripts that mutate HTML must carry an `<!-- AUTOGEN:<MARKER> -->` comment for
idempotency so re-runs are no-ops on already-processed pages.

Do not place application source code, HTML templates (those go in
`assets/templates/`), or test fixtures here.

#### 2.2.1 Per-site directory inventory (Glee-fully Tools)

Current state of shared directories as surveyed 2026-05-29. Use this as the
baseline -- update it here when the inventory changes materially.

| Directory | Current state | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `assets/audit/` | 21 JSON result files + `screenshots/` subfolder | Most complete audit record; includes viewport QA batch runs |
| `assets/css/` | `theme.css` (142 KB) | Largest of the three; includes GLEE scope |
| `assets/data/` | `search-index.json`, `sparkle.json`, `icon-map.json` | All three data files present |
| `assets/downloads/` | `.gitkeep` only | Add user-facing downloads when available |
| `assets/docs/` | 12 Markdown docs | Includes `gleefully-replit-theme-guide.md`, multiple audit and evaluation reports |
| `assets/img/` | 198+ brand and GPT-icon PNG files + 5 subdirs | Largest image set; includes all tool-ette GPT icon variants |
| `assets/img/favicons/` | 8 files | Full PNG set plus the SVG master |
| `assets/img/library/` | `.gitkeep` only | Populate with reusable brand variants |
| `assets/img/webp/` | 270 WebP files | Fully populated; hero images and all GPT icon variants at 150/300/512/600/1024w |
| `assets/js/` | `app.js` (40 KB), `mermaid-init.js` | `sparkle-loader.js` removed 2026-05-28; logic merged into `app.js` |
| `assets/templates/` | 10 templates + `INDEX.md` | Toolbox-specific types: `template--hub-branch.html`, `template--hub-toolbox.html`, `template--tool-detail.html` |
| `docs/` | `adr/` subfolder with 8 ADRs + `README.md` + `template.md`, `roadmap.md`, and `threat-model.md`; `.gitkeep` | ADR-0008 adds recurring technology-version review on 2026-09-18; planning and security documents live here |
| `docs/archive/` | `.gitkeep` only | Add archived sprint docs here |
| `scripts/` | <!-- STAT:SCRIPTS-PY -->37<!-- /STAT:SCRIPTS-PY --> active Python scripts + <!-- STAT:SCRIPTS-OTHER -->2<!-- /STAT:SCRIPTS-OTHER --> non-Python runners (`responsive-qa.mjs`, `post-merge.sh`); 47 reference-only/retired Python scripts moved to `scripts/archive/` | Updated 2026-10-01; `check-foundry-accessibility-report.py` validates the FoundRy evidence contract; `technology-versions.py` inventories versions and checks publisher releases; `sync-universe-map.py` generates the public map after indexing. See `scripts/README.md` for active/archive classification. |

**Glee-fully-specific sub-folders under `assets/img/`:**
- `assets/img/tool-ettes/` -- per-tool-ette hero images (one image per tool-ette
  page, used by `scripts/activate-icons.py`).
- `assets/img/toolbox/` -- toolbox hub section images.

**Glee-fully-specific data files:**
- `assets/data/sparkle.json` -- single-source "Today's Sparkle" banner data
- `assets/data/icon-map.json` -- slug-to-icon-path registry for GPT tool icons

**Glee-fully-specific scripts not on siblings:**
Active: `check-accent-contrast.py`, `check-glee-dark-coverage.py`,
`check-public-headers.py`, `check-workflow-actions.py`, `run-viewport-qa.py`,
`inclusive-accessibility-qa.py`, `public-artifact.py`, `serve-site.py`, `sparkle-qa.py`,
`sync-css-version.py`, `sync-image-alt.py`,
`sync-foundation-files.py`, `sync-portfolio-stats.py`, `sync-social-card.py`,
`sync-sparkle-fallback.py`, `technology-versions.py`.
`activate-icons.py`, `add-toolbox-to-footer.py`, `add-noreferrer.py`,
`convert-gpt-icons-webp.py`, `fix-audit-2026-05-12.py`,
`fix-footer-nav-2026-07-20.py`, `fix-placeholder-gpt-links.py`,
`generate-illustrations.py`, `inject-gpt-icon-picture.py`,
`inject-keep-exploring.py`, `inject-showcase-footer.py`,
`inject-showcase-subnav.py`, `inject-toolette-hub.py`,
`reclassify-construction-banners.py`, `update-card-srcsets.py`, `viewport-qa.py`,
and `wire-illustrations.py` were also Glee-fully-specific but are
reference-only or retired as of 2026-08-30 -- see `scripts/README.md`,
they now live in `scripts/archive/` and are no longer part of the active
toolchain.

**Using `scripts/`:** `scripts/README.md` classifies every script as active,
reference-only, or retired -- only active scripts remain at the top level of
`scripts/`; everything else lives in `scripts/archive/` with the
classification and rationale recorded there. Use `scripts/audit-site.py`
for the canonical site audit, `scripts/validate-site.py` for structural
validation, and `scripts/check-links.py`/`scripts/responsive-qa.mjs` for
link and responsive QA. Do not run an archived script without reading its
header and confirming its target paths still apply -- several were written
for an earlier repo layout or reference sibling-site constants. This
convention was ported from `askjamie/scripts/README.md`; see
`overkill-hill/docs/sxs-infrastructure-audit-2026-08-29.md` for the full
classification evidence.

### 3. Detritus (what does not belong in version control)

Replit Agent generates working artifacts during a build. Some are useful in
the moment and become noise the next week. The categories below are detritus
by default and must be gitignored, moved to a proper home, or deleted.

#### 3.1 Replit working-buffer artifacts

- **`attached_assets/`**: paste-buffer transcripts and screenshots from Replit
  Agent prompts. Filenames look like `Pasted--<title>-<timestamp>.txt` or
  `image_<timestamp>.png`. Never useful after the session. Always gitignore.
  Delete from history if accidentally committed.
- **`_unused/`**: code Replit moved out of the way during a refactor. Read it
  once to confirm nothing important is stranded, then delete the folder.
- **`attached-assets/`** (hyphen variant) and **`unused/`**: same rules.

#### 3.2 Test and build output

- **`test-results/`**: Playwright run output. Always gitignored. Delete if
  committed.
- **`playwright-report/`**: same.
- **`coverage/`**: same.
- **`build/`**, **`.next/`**, **`.vite/`**: build output. Gitignore.
- **`dist/`**: build output — gitignore. Note: in OverKill Hill P³, `dist/` serves
  as the cross-site sync staging area and is intentional; see that repo's
  AGENTS.md sections 2.2.1 and 3.2.
- **`node_modules/`**: already gitignored by default; verify.

#### 3.3 IDE and OS junk

- **`.DS_Store`**, **`Thumbs.db`**, **`.idea/`**, **`.vscode/`** (with
  team-specific settings): gitignore unless the project deliberately ships a
  workspace config.

#### 3.4 Stale planning artifacts

- **`_replit/`**: old Replit working notes that may contain genuinely useful
  audits or sprint plans. Triage before deleting: move anything worth keeping
  into `assets/docs/` or `assets/docs/archive/`, delete the rest.

#### 3.5 Duplicated content from sibling repos

When an agent copies a skill or asset from another repo, it sometimes lands in
the wrong repo. If the skill or folder is not actually owned by this app,
remove it.

#### 3.6 Pre-deploy preview directories

Pre-deploy previews of sibling apps copied into this repo are dead weight once
the live URL is deployed. Delete them.

---

### 4. Required `.gitignore` entries

Every OKHP3 repo must include at least the following. Add these where absent.

```
# Replit working-buffer artifacts
attached_assets/
attached-assets/
_unused/
unused/

# Test and build output
test-results/
playwright-report/
coverage/
dist/
build/
.next/
.vite/

# IDE / OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
.idea/

# Node
node_modules/
*.log
```

If a folder in this list is currently tracked, remove it from the index before
committing the `.gitignore` change so it disappears from tracking.

---

### 5. Decrapify command (reusable instruction)

When the repo accumulates working artifacts, paste this message to Replit Agent:

> **Decrapify this repo per the Repository Hygiene Standard in `AGENTS.md`
> Section 5.** Triage, do not just delete. Produce a plan first, then execute
> on confirmation. Cover: `attached_assets/` and any hyphen variant, `_unused/`,
> `test-results/`, `playwright-report/`, `coverage/`, `dist/`, `build/`,
> `_replit/` (triage into `assets/docs/` or `assets/docs/archive/` before
> deleting), any duplicated sibling-repo content, any file or folder violating
> Section 1, and any forbidden folder name from Section 3. Output a plan with
> four sections: A. DELETE / B. GITIGNORE-AND-UNTRACK / C. TRIAGE-THEN-DELETE /
> D. RENAME. Wait for "go" before executing.

### 6. Brand contract (Glee-fully Tools)

This repo serves the Glee-fully Tools brand.
Canonical reference: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OKHP3/OverKill-Hill/main/assets/css/theme.css
(scope `.glee-main`)

Glee-fully motif declared values:

| Aspect | Value |
|---|---|
| Body scope class | `glee-main` (pages MUST set `<body class="glee-main">`) |
| Heading font | Fredoka, with Poppins fallback |
| Body font | Open Sans |
| Mono font | JetBrains Mono |
| Page background | cream `#f6f2ee` |
| Card surface | `#fffdfa` |
| Text / ink | charcoal `#2e2b29` |
| Primary accent | coral `#d94f63` |
| Secondary accent | teal `#2d6f7e` |
| Primary button | gradient `linear-gradient(135deg, #d94f63, #d35b2d)` |
| Mermaid line/border | coral `#d94f63` |
| Tone | bright, playful, warm |

**Forbidden in this brand's apps:**
- Rust-orange `#c46a2c` (that is OverKill Hill P3)
- Forge espresso/teal dark palette (that is OverKill Hill P3)
- Alfa Slab One headings (that is OverKill Hill P3)
- Industrial / forge aesthetic, blueprint grids, slab serifs
- Builders FirstSource (BFS) references, color systems, or examples of any kind

---

### 7. Universal guardrails

These apply in every session, regardless of task:

- No em dashes anywhere (code, comments, copy, commit messages). Use periods
  or restructure the sentence.
- No AI filler in copy or comments: not "seamlessly," "robust," "powerful,"
  "effortlessly," "elevate," "unleash."
- Tailwind v4 only if Tailwind is in use: no `tailwind.config.js` (tokens live
  in CSS via `@theme inline`).
- No new dependencies unless explicitly requested.
- All user-facing content must use US English per the Language Standard in
  Section 0. UK and Commonwealth spellings are defects, not stylistic variants.
- **ROY principle:** ratio of understanding produced to explanation invested.
  Verbosity must earn its space. Prefer punchy standalone lines over prose
  consolidation. Do not pad responses.
- **AutoCAD version:** R10 (locked, not negotiable). Do not reference or suggest
  any other AutoCAD release in this project's documentation or tooling.

---

### 8. US English audit command (reusable instruction)

When the repo accumulates UK or Commonwealth spellings, paste this message to
Replit Agent:

> **Run the US English audit per the Language Standard in `AGENTS.md` Section
> 0.** Produce a QA summary first; execute corrections only after I say "go."
> Cover: UI copy, docs, README, release notes, human-readable comments,
> prompts, tooltips, error and validation messages, and QA/QC reports. Apply
> protected exceptions in Section 0. For existing code identifiers with UK
> spellings, list them as renaming candidates but do not auto-rename without
> confirmation. Output: (1) files scanned, (2) files to change, (3) UK spellings
> found with location, (4) US-EN replacements proposed, (5) protected exceptions
> intentionally left unchanged with reason, (6) identifier renaming candidates
> flagged for separate handling, (7) final confirmation the report itself
> contains no UK spellings. Wait for "go." No em dashes.
