### 🛠 Maintainers' notes

* **Live audit reports:** `FINAL_AUDIT_2026-05-03.md`, plus
  `AUDIT_PAGE_INVENTORY_*`, `AUDIT_LINKS_*`, `AUDIT_ASSETS_*`,
  `AUDIT_ACCESSIBILITY_*`, `AUDIT_PERFORMANCE_*` covering every phase of the
  2026-05-03 pass.
* **Run validators after content edits:**
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/validate-site.py  &&  python3 scripts/check-links.py
  ```
  Exit 0 = safe to publish.
* **Rebuild search/feed/icon map after content edits:**
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/build-search-index.py
  python3 scripts/audit-assets.py
  python3 scripts/generate-feed.py
  ```
* **Add a new tool-ette page:** drop the new `Glee-fullyTools-GPTIcon-…` PNG
  into `assets/img/`, add its URL to `sitemap.xml`, then run the four
  mutator scripts in order (`normalize-head` → `activate-icons` → `inject-jsonld`
  → `inject-breadcrumb`) and the three regenerators above. See `replit.md` for
  the detailed run order.
* **Template library:** `assets/templates/` mirrors the full site hierarchy
  with structural-only clones of every page. Every template preserves nav,
  footer, scripts, CSS, JSON-LD scaffold; every page-specific value is a
  `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` token. Documented in `assets/templates/TEMPLATE_INDEX.md`.
  Regenerate with `python3 scripts/generate-templates.py` (idempotent; pass
  `--force` to overwrite). Templates are dev artifacts and are excluded from
  the sitemap, search index, feed, and every validator.
