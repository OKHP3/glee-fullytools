# Glee-fully Personalizable Tools™

Welcome to **Glee-fully Personalizable Tools™** - a joyful studio of personalizable tools for everyday life, work and wonder, evolving beyond its original Custom GPT platform.
We believe creativity thrives when structure and delight work together, so we built a platform that does both.

### 🌟 Overview

At **Glee-fully™**, every Tool, Tool-ette, and Function is designed to adapt to
*you*.
Whether you’re exploring new career paths, planning meals, organizing projects, or simply rediscovering balance, our systems learn your rhythm — adding polish without pressure.  

We treat technology like a friend with good taste: it remembers what you love, keeps you organized, and always makes things feel a little more *you*.

### 🧰 Explore the Suite

Our growing ecosystem includes:

- **Discovered Careers** – find paths that match your spark and story.  
- **Organized Life** – design routines that work *with* you, not against you.  
- **Healthy Bee-ing** – track habits, moods, and motivation with kindness.  
- **Traveler’s Guide** – plan journeys with purpose and ease.  
- **Treasured Finds** – curate collections and memories worth keeping.  
- …and more under our seven Tool branches and 42 catalog Tool-ettes.

Every element is crafted to be modular, charming, and useful — a mix of retro aesthetics and modern AI intelligence wrapped in authentic warmth.

### 🌱 Current phase

Glee-fully Tools is in an **active platform transition**. OpenAI has scheduled
Custom GPT retirement for December 11, 2026. The owner is preserving and
replatforming the original concepts into reusable Agent Skills and plugins.
See the [public transition page](https://glee-fully.tools/next-chapter/).

The catalog preserves 42 Tool-ettes. Its original 1 live, 24 beta and 17
unavailable labels describe the GPT catalog, not replacement readiness.
The authoritative inventory and completion contract live in
[`docs/suite-promise.md`](docs/suite-promise.md).

### 💡 Why We Exist

Because AI should *feel good to use*.  
We believe productivity tools shouldn’t drain your energy or hide behind jargon. **Glee-fully™** reimagines personalization as joy — not data extraction.  
Our suite shows that structure can be playful, creativity can be systematic, and technology can be *deeply human*.

### 📚 Public inventory

- **65** production HTML files, including utility and fallback pages
- **62** indexable public pages in the sitemap and search index
- **1** Toolbox hub, **7** branch hubs, and **42** Tool-ette pages
- **49** Atom feed entries for the branch and Tool-ette catalog

The feed is an update stream rather than a mirror of every public page, and the
9 structural templates under `assets/templates/` are development artifacts,
not additional public pages.

The [FoundRy feature page](foundry/) introduces the locally run workbench with public source
behind Glee-fully tooling. It is a public explanation, not a hosted builder launch.

### 🛠 Maintainers' notes

* **Technology updates:** the [inventory and upgrade plan](docs/technology-update-plan.md)
  covers runtime, QA, platform, and dependency versions. The [version register](docs/technology-version-register.md)
  includes all npm lock entries and publisher release evidence. Weekly Dependabot
  PRs and Technology Version Review keep update candidates visible after merge.
* **Audit evidence:** dated files under `assets/audit/` and `assets/docs/` are
  historical records. Current validator and link reports use the run date;
  never treat an older dated report as current evidence.
* **Run validators after content edits:**
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/validate-site.py  &&  python3 scripts/check-links.py
  ```
  Exit 0 = safe to publish.
* **Mermaid runtime:** the `ecosystem/` and `universe/` diagrams run on
  Mermaid, vendored locally at `assets/vendor/mermaid/` (not loaded from a
  CDN). `assets/vendor/mermaid/VERSION` pins the exact release, currently 12.0.0; a daily
  `mermaid-version-watch` GitHub Action compares it against the latest npm
  release and opens/updates a tracking issue when the vendored copy falls
  behind -- re-vendoring is a deliberate, reviewed step, never automatic.
  `scripts/validate-site.py` checks the VERSION pin against the vendored
  bundle and that every page with a live diagram carries a CSP class that
  allows Mermaid's runtime-generated inline styles (see `scripts/csp.py`).
  Every page's CSP is now enforced via a per-page <meta> tag
  (`scripts/generate-csp.py`) -- previously only defined, unenforced, in
  `_headers`, which GitHub Pages does not serve.
* **Privacy boundary:** optional Google Analytics is off by default and can be
   enabled or withdrawn from [`legal/`](legal/). Google Fonts remains a
   documented brand dependency; Ko-fi is outbound navigation only. The
   complete request, storage, embed, and offline-cache inventory is in
   [`docs/privacy-data-flows.md`](docs/privacy-data-flows.md).
* **Rebuild the search index and asset map after content edits:**
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/build-search-index.py
   python3 scripts/archive/audit-assets.py
   python3 scripts/generate-sitemap.py
   python3 scripts/generate-feed.py
   ```
* **Add a new tool-ette page:** drop the new `Glee-fullyTools-GPTIcon-…` PNG
   into `assets/img/`, place the page inside the shared URL scope in
   `config/public-inventory.json`, then run the
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/build-search-index.py
   python3 scripts/generate-sitemap.py
   python3 scripts/generate-feed.py
   ```
   Do not hand-edit generated discovery artifacts.
* **Template library:** `assets/templates/` mirrors the full site hierarchy
  with structural-only clones of every page. Every template preserves nav,
  footer, scripts, CSS, JSON-LD scaffold; every page-specific value is a
  `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` token. Documented in `assets/templates/INDEX.md`. The
  current templates are maintained directly as nine structural files; the
  superseded `scripts/generate-templates.py` generator should not be rerun.
  Templates are dev artifacts and are excluded from the sitemap, search index,
  feed, and every validator.
