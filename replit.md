# Glee-fully Personalizable Tools™

A joyful static website serving as a public catalog and routing hub for custom
GPTs organized in a "trunk-branch-twig" hierarchy. It is part of the OKHP³™
(OverKill Hill P³) universe. The current phase is **active growth and
refinement**; the hub does not certify every external GPT as finished or
available. The authoritative promise and inventory contract is
`docs/suite-promise.md`.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Pure HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript (no application build system)
- **Styling:** Shared `assets/css/theme.css` with scoped GLOBAL, OVERKILL, GLEE,
  ASKJAMIE, and CROSS-BRAND sections. Glee-fully pages use the coral and cream
  brand contract documented in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Fonts:** Google Fonts (Fredoka, Open Sans, Poppins, and DM Sans)
- **Dependencies:** Mermaid v12.0.0 is vendored locally. Google Fonts is external;
  Google Analytics G-89W66VMGPB loads only after opt-in. Ko-fi is an outbound
  link. Optional local Node metadata exists for
  Lighthouse and Puppeteer, but the site does not run on Node or a bundler.
- **Hosting:** Static site served with Python's built-in HTTP server in dev

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main landing page with JSON-LD WebSite+Organization schema
- `assets/css/theme.css` — Central stylesheet, organized into scope-grouped sections: GLOBAL → OVERKILL → GLEE → ASKJAMIE → CROSS-BRAND. Each scope has a boxed banner. Current counts come from the source and generated portfolio statistics; historical scope-map counts below retain their original dates.
- `assets/js/app.js` — Shared JS: progress bar, theme toggle, mobile nav, sticky-TOC module, and the full search engine (search.js merged into app.js 2026-05-04). Exposes `window.GleeSearch` for debugging.
- `assets/js/mermaid-init.js`: Local initializer importing vendored Mermaid v12.0.0 (used by ecosystem + universe pages). Both pages also carry a single `.mermaid-referral` credit linking to the paid-referral URL `https://mermaidchart.cello.so/UhVlNtC2MlS` in Mermaid hot-pink `#FF3670`. `scripts/validate-site.py` enforces a one-instance-per-Mermaid-page invariant so this credit can never silently be dropped.
- `assets/img/` — Branded butterfly and GPT icons
- `sw.js` — Root-scoped service worker with a versioned, same-origin offline shell and `/offline.html` fallback
- `toolbox/`  -  Central hub with 1 Toolbox page, 7 thematic branches, and 42
  Tool-ette pages
- `about/`, `contact/`, `legal/`, `persona/`, `universe/`, `ecosystem/`, `showcase/`, `foundry/` — Supporting pages (`showcase/` is the portfolio case-study page added 2026-05-27)
- `robots.txt` — Bot policy (GPTBot blocked for training; OAI-SearchBot, ChatGPT-User allowed)
- `sitemap.xml`  -  61 indexable public URLs
- `feed.xml`  -  49 branch and Tool-ette update entries (not a full-site mirror)

## Workflows

- **Start application:** `python3 scripts/serve-site.py` (port 5000, no-cache webview)

On Windows, set `$env:PYTHONUTF8='1'` in PowerShell and use an existing working
Python 3 interpreter instead of `python3`. `py -3` works only if its registered
interpreter exists. The September 5 local checks used the installed Codex
bundled Python when the system launcher pointed to a missing executable.
Python browser runners require the pinned Python Playwright runtime/browser;
static-lint fallback is not browser evidence. The focused FoundRy Node runner
uses its separately declared Playwright package. CI restores the locked npm
dependencies and installs `chromium`, `firefox`, and `webkit` drivers. Invoke
`npm run qa:foundry-accessibility` once with each explicit selector:
`--engine chromium`, `--engine firefox`, and `--engine webkit`. Each invocation
checks 320×780, 390×844, and the CSS compact-navigation boundary at 768×1024.
It reports `NOT RUN` with a reason and exits nonzero if its runtime is unavailable;
Pages CI runs all three as a blocking gate and retains separate reports. Do not
add or upgrade dependencies for this check.

## CI Gate (GitHub Actions)

### Protected-main synchronization

GitHub `main` is the canonical release branch and requires a pull request.
The local pre-push hook also blocks direct pushes to `main`. New Replit work
must start on a named branch, be pushed to that branch, and pass the required
checks in a pull request before merging. A clean working tree can still have
unpublished commits; inspect `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main`
after `git fetch origin`.

After the pull request merges, use `git switch main` and
`git merge --ff-only origin/main` in each clean checkout after fetching.
If a fast-forward fails, preserve the local tip and inspect the divergence;
do not repeatedly pull, reset `main`, or force-push. Preserve commit ancestry
when reconciling commits already made on Replit `main`, so both checkouts can
fast-forward after the integration PR. Refresh Replit's Git panel separately
from the Shell; a working Shell transport does not prove the Replit Git
Providers connector is authenticated.

`.github/workflows/validate.yml` runs on every push and pull request to `main`:

1. **`validate-site.py`** — checks all pages for title, h1, description, canonical, og:url, theme-color, manifest, favicon, skip link, JSON-LD parseability, Mermaid referral invariant. Also enforces a global **CSS-lines drift invariant**: the `<!-- STAT:CSS-LINES -->` value in `showcase/index.html` must be within ±50 lines of the actual `theme.css` line count (fix by running `python3 scripts/sync-portfolio-stats.py`). Exits non-zero on any critical issue.
2. **`check-links.py`** — validates every internal href against the filesystem and cross-references against `sitemap.xml`. Exits non-zero on broken links or sitemap mismatches.
3. **`build-search-index.py --check`** — compares `assets/data/search-index.json` with the source without rewriting it; fails if committed output is missing or stale.

This gate prevents regressions (deprecated meta tags, broken hrefs, missing metadata, stale search index) from reaching the live GitHub Pages deployment.

The standalone `.github/workflows/resilience-qa.yml` gate runs
`scripts/resilience-qa.py` with Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. It proves the
installability contract, crawler-visible metadata, representative
online-to-offline navigation, service-worker cache lifecycle, and graceful
behavior when Google, Ko-fi, Analytics, Arcade, or other external requests
fail. Read [`docs/resilience.md`](docs/resilience.md) for the exact boundary;
third-party GPTs and embeds remain online-only.

## Agent Governance

The file `.agents/agent-skills.md` is the site-specific operating constitution for any AI agent working on this codebase. **Read it before making any changes.**

It contains:
- **6 Core Constraints** (never violate): static-only architecture, no build steps without approval, brand voice, trunk→branch→tool-ette taxonomy, no fabricated content, idempotent scripts only
- **CSS Scope Map** with rules on where to place new styles
- **Auto-generated file registry** — files that must not be hand-edited
- **Mermaid referral invariant** — enforced by `validate-site.py`
- **10 named agent skills** covering audit, responsive QA, portfolio positioning, brand, accessibility, SEO, conversion, artifact proof, staleness detection, and safety governance
- **Script quick reference** with the correct run order

Before any session: run `python3 scripts/validate-site.py` and `python3 scripts/check-links.py` to confirm a clean baseline. Run both again after your changes. The site must exit 0 on both validators when you hand back.

## Deployment

Configured as a **static** deployment with `publicDir: "."` — no build step needed.
GitHub Pages publishing is defined in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`. The workflow
checks the exact `main` commit, verifies generated outputs are current, runs the
static release gates, preserves `CNAME` in a clean Pages artifact, and deploys
only that artifact after the validation job succeeds. A green local audit or
Actions validation job alone is not proof that the public Pages URL is healthy;
owner-side live smoke testing remains a separate confirmation.

### Release sequence

Run this from a clean checkout before opening or merging a release change:

```bash
python3 scripts/build-search-index.py --check
python3 scripts/sync-portfolio-stats.py --check
python3 scripts/sync-css-version.py --check
python3 scripts/validate-site.py
python3 scripts/check-links.py
python3 scripts/audit-site.py --quiet  # advisory report; inspect findings
python3 scripts/check-accent-contrast.py --strict
python3 scripts/check-glee-dark-coverage.py --section all --require-both
python3 scripts/resilience-qa.py --static-only
```

If a check reports stale generated output, run the named synchronizer, review
the generated diff, and rerun the check-only sequence. The Pages workflow also
requires `CNAME` to contain exactly `glee-fully.tools` and verifies that the
artifact contains the homepage, 404 page, robots policy, sitemap, and manifest.
The Pages workflow also runs the supported browser viewport/asset QA before
deployment. The standalone viewport workflow remains useful for fast feedback
on responsive changes.

The current detailed release handoff, runtime inventory, and unresolved CI/host
choices are in `docs/remaining-program-2026-09-05/platform-release.md`.
`scripts/tests/test-release-readiness.cjs` can exercise installed Node Playwright
engines. It is supplementary evidence, not execution of the Python browser gates.
The Python viewport and inclusive runners still call the Nix/gcc shim setup
unconditionally; do not invoke that host-specific setup on Windows. The proposed
host-aware fix is documented in the handoff and remains separately reviewed work.

The three companion repositories use the same release stages but retain
site-specific adapters for domains, page inventories, generated files, browser
paths, and brand checks. See `docs/companion-publishing-contract.md`.

## CSS Scope Map (post 2026-05-02 reorganization)

When editing `theme.css`, find the right scope first:

| Scope | Starts at | What lives here | Selector pattern |
|---|---:|---|---|
| GLOBAL | L 20 | Tokens, reset, layout, header/nav, footer, scroll-reveal, articles, Ko-fi, search engine, and shared utilities | unscoped or `:root` / `body` |
| OVERKILL | L 2509 | Default OverKill Hill chrome and Mermaid skin | `body:not(.glee-main):not(.askjamie-main) …` |
| GLEE | L 4329 | Glee-fully brand chrome and Mermaid skin | `.glee-main …` / `body.glee-main …` |
| ASKJAMIE | L 5230 | AskJamie chrome and Mermaid skin | `.askjamie-main …` / `body.askjamie-main …` |
| CROSS-BRAND | No dedicated section | Shared rules remain in GLOBAL or the relevant brand block | Use the existing selector scope |

When diffing against sibling repos: differences inside GLOBAL/CROSS-BRAND blocks should be reconciled; differences inside the OVERKILL/GLEE/ASKJAMIE blocks are intentional brand divergence. Pre-reorg backup at `assets/css/theme.css.bak-prereorg`.

## Inline-content audit (2026-05-02)

Site already at GitHub Pages best practices: 0 inline `<style>` blocks; only 2 trivial single-use `style="…"` attributes (toolbox/06-healthy-bee-ing); 13 inline JSON-LD blocks (must stay inline per Schema.org). All shared CSS/JS properly externalized.

## Site-wide enhancements (2026-05-02 polish pass)

Applied to every real HTML page (62 pages):

- **"Built with Replit" footer attribution** — `.footer-replit-credit` on the left edge of the 2-column `.footer-bottom`, links to `https://replit.com/refer/overkillhillp3/` (referral). Replit brand orange `#f26207`.
- **Google Analytics propagation** — `gtag.js` + inline `gtag('config','G-89W66VMGPB')` now in every page's `<head>` (was only on `index.html`).
- **Skip-to-content link** (a11y) — `<a class="skip-to-content" href="#main">` injected as first child of `<body>` on every page; visually hidden until keyboard-focused.
- **`theme-color` meta** — added on the 11 pages that were missing it (mobile browser chrome).
- **`og:locale` meta** — added on the 4 pages that were missing it (social-card completeness).
- **`loading="lazy" decoding="async"` on below-header images** — added to 54 images. Header logo intentionally preserved as eager-loaded to protect LCP.

The mutator script (`/tmp/enhance_pages.py`) is idempotent — each transformation has a "skip if already present" guard, so re-running is safe.

## SEO & Metadata Status (as of 2026-04-11)

All 59 HTML pages have been fully audited and updated:

| Signal | Status |
|---|---|
| Canonical URL / og:url | ✅ Fixed (was broken on 9 pages) |

| JSON-LD schema | ✅ Homepage (WebSite + Organization) |
| Inline style= attributes | ✅ Extracted to utility classes (.mt-075, .mt-1–.mt-4) |

## Cross-site Sync Notes (overkillhill.com reference)

Historical notes from the April 2026 alignment. Mermaid v11 references here
describe that earlier state; the current local runtime is pinned by
`assets/vendor/mermaid/VERSION`.

- CSS utility classes appended to `theme.css` (`.mermaid foreignObject` fix, `.text-amber`, `.link-amber`, `.diagram-*`, `.section-subtitle`, `.council-*`, `.mt-*` spacing helpers)
- Twitter handle: `@OverKillHillP3` used as site-wide `twitter:site` and `twitter:creator`
- Mermaid v11 ESM pattern now matches sibling sites
- 2 multi-property inline styles remain in `toolbox/06-healthy-bee-ing/index.html` (lines 290, 437) — they bundle font-size + max-width alongside margin-top and require page-specific class names

## Internal Site Search (added 2026-05-02)

A zero-dependency, fully client-side search engine indexes every published page so visitors can jump anywhere without clicking through the trunk-branch-twig hierarchy.

| Component | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Index builder | `scripts/build-search-index.py` | Walks every `*.html`, extracts title/description/canonical/h1-h3/body, writes `assets/data/search-index.json` |
| Search index | `assets/data/search-index.json` | 61 indexable pages, ~430 KB raw — committed to repo, no backend needed |
| Runtime | `assets/js/app.js` (search section, line 263+) | Lazy-loads index, tokenizes query, weighted field scoring, renders modal results |
| Styles | `assets/css/theme.css` (search section at end) | Modal, nav button, result cards, dark-mode aware |
| Wired into | All 61 indexable HTML pages | `<script src="/assets/js/app.js" defer>` — single script, no separate search.js |

**Triggers:** Click magnifier in nav · press `/` outside an input · press ⌘K / Ctrl+K · arrive at any page with `?s=query` (matches the JSON-LD `SearchAction` declared on the homepage)

**Rebuilding the index:** Run `python3 scripts/build-search-index.py` after content changes. The generator excludes `404.html`, `under-construction.html`, and `offline.html`.

## Offline shell

The site registers `sw.js` from the shared `app.js` entry point. The worker
pre-caches a small, versioned same-origin shell (home, search, toolbox, about,
local CSS/JavaScript/data, manifest, and favicon), caches successful same-origin
HTML navigations for repeat visits, and serves `offline.html` when a navigation
cannot reach the network. It never intercepts or caches third-party requests,
including fonts, analytics, Ko-fi, ChatGPT, Mermaid, and the arcade iframe.

After changing a pre-cached asset, run `python3 scripts/sync-css-version.py`
last to derive the cache version and CSS token from content. The offline page
is deliberately excluded from the search index and sitemap.

**Why no Lunr.js or Algolia:** The site has 61 indexable pages and the raw search index is ~430 KB. A homemade weighted scorer (title × 10, headings × 5, description × 4, body × 1) is plenty fast at this scale and adds zero external dependencies, matching the site's no-build philosophy.

**Two surfaces, one engine:** The search section of `app.js` powers (a) the global ⌘K/`/` modal injected into every page's nav, and (b) the dedicated `/search/` page. The dedicated page declares `data-glee-search-inline` on `<main>` plus three hooks: `[data-glee-search-inline-input]`, `[data-glee-search-inline-status]`, `[data-glee-search-inline-results]`. On boot it detects the inline marker and runs `attachInline()` instead of opening the modal — and writes the query back into the URL as `?q=` for shareability. The `?s=` param still auto-opens the modal everywhere else.

## Today's Sparkle management

The sparkle banner (`<section class="site-specials">`) appears in the `<header>` of all 64 HTML pages. It highlights the current featured GPT Tool.

| Component | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Source of truth | `assets/data/sparkle.json` | `emoji`, `label`, `description`, `suffix`, `url`, `updated` — edit this to change the sparkle |
| Runtime loader | `assets/js/app.js` §6 | Fetches sparkle.json on page load, overwrites `[data-sparkle-link]` href + text in the browser |
| Static fallback sync | `scripts/sync-sparkle-fallback.py` | Patches every HTML file's `[data-sparkle-link]` href + text so the pre-JS state matches the JSON |

**When you update the sparkle (change `assets/data/sparkle.json`):**

1. Edit `assets/data/sparkle.json` with the new `emoji`, `label`, `description`, `suffix`, and `url`.
2. Run `python3 scripts/sync-sparkle-fallback.py` to patch the static fallback in all 64 HTML files.
3. The runtime loader in `app.js` §6 handles live browser updates automatically — no JS changes needed.

The sync script is idempotent: safe to re-run; it skips files already up to date.

## Current maintenance commands (2026-09-05)

`scripts/README.md` is the active script inventory. Source editing is followed
by these serial generators, with the generated diff reviewed before validation:

```bash
python3 scripts/build-search-index.py
python3 scripts/sync-portfolio-stats.py
python3 scripts/build-search-index.py
python3 scripts/sync-css-version.py
```

The second index pass captures any stats copy changes. Then run the check-only
release sequence above and the focused regressions relevant to the change.
`bash scripts/post-merge.sh` checks committed index, stats, discovery artifacts,
CSP, structure and links. It also idempotently synchronizes CSS, JavaScript, and
offline-shell cache versions so a merge cannot leave the local checkout with a
stale cache token. Run it only in a Bash environment with a working `python3`;
use the equivalent Python checks directly on Windows when that environment is
unavailable.

`feed.xml` is a current generated release output. Rebuild it with
`scripts/generate-feed.py`; do not hand-edit it. `icon-map.json` uses the
compatibility audit under `scripts/archive/` and is not part of the discovery
scope contract.

## Historical validation tooling (2026-05-03, superseded)

Seven standalone Python scripts under `scripts/` keep the site honest. **Run order
matters** — `inject-jsonld` reads `og:image` to set `primaryImageOfPage`, so it
must run *after* `activate-icons`; `inject-breadcrumb` reads the JSON-LD that
`inject-jsonld` writes, so it must run *after* both of those.

```bash
# 1. Mutators (idempotent, AUTOGEN-marker-driven)
python3 scripts/normalize-head.py     # canonical favicon chain + theme-color
python3 scripts/activate-icons.py     # hero <img> + og:image swap to per-tool icons
python3 scripts/inject-jsonld.py      # JSON-LD @graph + BreadcrumbList
python3 scripts/inject-breadcrumb.py  # visible <nav aria-label="Breadcrumb">

# 2. Index and asset maintenance
python3 scripts/build-search-index.py    # rebuilds assets/data/search-index.json
python3 scripts/sync-portfolio-stats.py  # patches About page stat counts from search-index.json
python3 scripts/archive/audit-assets.py # compatibility audit for icon-map + dated asset inventory
python3 scripts/generate-sitemap.py     # rebuilds sitemap.xml from the shared inventory
python3 scripts/generate-feed.py        # rebuilds feed.xml from the shared inventory

# 3. Validators (exit non-zero on regressions; safe to wire into CI)
python3 scripts/validate-site.py      # every-page metadata + structure checks
python3 scripts/check-links.py        # every internal href + sitemap parity

# 4. WebP image pipeline (run when new PNG images are added)
python3 scripts/convert-hero-webp.py       # Wide 1536 butterfly hero PNGs → WebP at 768/1024/1536w
python3 scripts/inject-hero-picture.py    # wraps butterfly hero <img> in <picture> with WebP sources
python3 scripts/convert-gpt-icons-webp.py  # GPT icon PNGs → WebP at 512/1024w (all RetroStripe variants)
python3 scripts/inject-gpt-icon-picture.py # wraps GPT icon <img> in <picture> with WebP sources

# 5. One-shot helpers (run when specific content changes)
python3 scripts/update-placeholder-dimensions.py  # update img width/height once artwork is uploaded
python3 scripts/post-merge.sh                     # auto-run on every task merge (rebuilds index + syncs portfolio stats)
```

Validators write machine-readable JSON to `assets/audit/` using a
`YYYY-MM-DD` run-date suffix. The current human-readable audit is
`assets/docs/audit-report.md` and includes its UTC generation time and run date;
older dated reports remain historical evidence. Re-running the mutators is
byte-idempotent — they are safe to re-run on every content edit.

## Template library (`assets/templates/`)

Nine structural HTML templates for the current page families.
Templates live **flat** in `assets/templates/` as `template--[slug].html`.
Each carries a full comment block enumerating every `[[UPPERCASE-KEBAB-CASE]]`
token before `<!DOCTYPE html>`. The index and workflow for adding new pages
live in `assets/templates/INDEX.md`.

| Template file | Type | Pages |
|---|---|---|
| `template--homepage.html` | homepage | 1 |
| `template--hub-toolbox.html` | hub-toolbox | 1 |
| `template--hub-branch.html` | hub-branch | 7 |
| `template--tool-detail.html` | tool-detail | 42 |
| `template--interior-single.html` | interior-single | 4 |
| `template--utility.html` | utility | 1 |
| `template--mermaid-diagram.html` | mermaid-diagram | 2 |
| `template--error.html` | error | 1 |
| `template--holding.html` | holding | 1 |

Templates are **development artifacts**, not crawlable pages — every
HTML-walking tool in `scripts/` excludes the entire `assets/` tree, so
templates are invisible to validators, indexer, sitemap, and feed.

**Superseded:** `scripts/generate-templates.py` generated the old per-page
60-file `{{DOUBLE_BRACE}}` system (deleted). Do **not** re-run it.
`TEMPLATE_INDEX.md` replaced by `assets/templates/INDEX.md`.

## Audit artifacts (2026-05-03)

All audit documents live in `assets/docs/` (non-crawlable, skipped by all HTML-walking tools):

* `assets/docs/FINAL_AUDIT_2026-05-03.md` — comprehensive 26-row change log, canonical reference
* `assets/docs/OPEN_TODOS_2026-05-03.md` — placeholder GPT URLs + deferred editorial items (updated 2026-05-26)
* `assets/docs/AUDIT_PAGE_INVENTORY_2026-05-03.md` — Phase 0 page inventory
* `assets/docs/AUDIT_LINKS_2026-05-03.md` — Phase 3 link audit
* `assets/docs/AUDIT_ASSETS_2026-05-03.md` — Phase 7 asset inventory
* `assets/docs/AUDIT_ACCESSIBILITY_2026-05-03.md` — Phase 8 accessibility audit
* `assets/docs/AUDIT_PERFORMANCE_2026-05-03.md` — Phase 10 performance audit
* `assets/docs/gleefully-replit-theme-guide.md` — Replit app theme configuration guide

Machine-readable JSON outputs live in `assets/audit/` (written by tools on each run):
`assets/audit/validation-report-2026-05-03.json`, `assets/audit/links-report-2026-05-03.json`, `assets/audit/asset-inventory-2026-05-03.json`

## Recent Changes

- **2026-05-27 — Dark mode + micro-animations (Task #26).** CSS-only additions to `assets/css/theme.css` (GLOBAL scope, before the OVERKILL banner at L 2502). Two new `@media` blocks totalling ~175 lines: (1) `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` — overrides all `.glee-main` token variables to warm-dark palette (`bg #1a1210`, `surface #241c1a`, `fg #f0e8e0`; coral accent lightened to `#f07585` for 4.9:1 contrast), plus explicit overrides for 14 component families: hero card, stripe sections, sparkle banner, nav submenu, footer, search modal, search page, construction overlay, keep-exploring tray, latest pill. (2) `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` — card `translateY(-2px)` lift on hover (150ms), primary button `scale(1.02) translateY(-1px)` compound on hover (100ms), quiet button `scale(1.02)` (100ms), `@keyframes gleeHeroH1In` fade-in + rise (400ms, play-once) on `.glee-main .glee-hero h1`. Zero HTML changes. Exit: 61/61 validator pages 0 issues, 0 warnings; 0 broken links (2,417 internal); 59/59 sitemap URLs.

- **2026-05-27 — WebP hero images with srcset (Task #25).** Generated WebP variants at 768w, 1024w, 1536w for 4 hero PNGs (`ButterflyLoopLeft`, `ButterflyLoopRight`, `TitleMidButterflyMultipleErrorExplosion`, `TitleUpperLeftButterflyMultipleUnderConstruction`) using Pillow (quality 85); saved to `assets/img/webp/` (12 files, 51 KB–216 KB). All 52 pages using these as hero images updated: bare `<img>` replaced with `<picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="…768w,1024w,1536w" sizes="100vw" /><img … /></picture>`; `loading="eager"` + `fetchpriority="high"` enforced on every hero. Two new idempotent scripts: `scripts/convert-hero-webp.py` (Pillow converter, supports `--force`) and `scripts/inject-hero-picture.py` (HTML mutator, AUTOGEN-safe). Exit: 61/61 validator pages 0 issues, 0 warnings; 0 broken links (2,417 internal); 59/59 sitemap URLs.

- **2026-05-27 — /showcase/ portfolio case-study page (Task #24).** Created `showcase/index.html` — a 6-section interior page covering: design challenge, information architecture (trunk→branch→tool-ette), technical architecture (zero-dependency frontend, client-side search, Python CI toolchain), design system (CSS scope map, token layer), governance model (agent-skills.md, AUTOGEN markers, template library), and a 6-pillar portfolio claims section. JSON-LD WebPage + BreadcrumbList, visible breadcrumb, keep-exploring CTA tray. `scripts/inject-showcase-footer.py` added /showcase/ to the footer nav on all 57 existing pages (idempotent, anchors on About Us entry). About page: "Read the full case study" + "Explore the Toolbox" CTAs added after portfolio-statement pillars. `sitemap.xml` updated to 59 URLs (lastmod 2026-05-27). `build-search-index.py` updated with "Showcase" section label.

- **2026-05-26 — Accessibility, performance & final report (Task #3).** Static audit across all 60 pages: 0 images missing alt text, 0 buttons without accessible label, skip links confirmed on all 60 pages, focus rings on all interactive elements, ARIA roles verified on search modal + nav toggle, reduced-motion respected. Color contrast analysis: accent orange (#d94f63/#d35b2d) at 3.4–3.6:1 passes WCAG AA for UI components/large bold text — documented as P2 advisory (no fix required). Replit footer credit (#f26207) at 2.89:1 noted as P3 deferred. Performance: 0 render-blocking external scripts, GA4 async, app.js + sparkle-loader deferred, Mermaid on 2 pages only, 4 preconnect hints on all 60 pages. Two P3 perf items deferred (construction-overlay lazy image, 12 images missing width/height). `assets/docs/LIVE_SITE_EVALUATION_2026-05-26.md` rewritten as the final 10-section report covering all 2026-05-26 session work.

- **2026-05-26 — Content, UX & construction banner polish (Task #2).** 3 placeholder GPT links resolved (`02c-present-hoarder`, `04d-dreamland-journeys`, `04e-memento-log`) using live URLs confirmed in branch pages. "Keep exploring" bottom-of-page nav tray injected on all 42 Tool-ette pages via `scripts/inject-keep-exploring.py` (idempotent, `<!-- AUTOGEN:KEEP-EXPLORING -->` marker); tray links: parent branch, prev sibling, next sibling, Toolbox, Search. Construction banners reclassified: branches 01–04, 07 converted from full modal overlay to slim `.construction-badge--slim` strip via `scripts/reclassify-construction-banners.py`; branch 06 (Healthy Bee-ing) retains full overlay pending 4 unfinished tool-ette links. CSS: `.construction-badge--slim` + `.keep-exploring` tray blocks added to `theme.css` (GLOBAL scope). Search index rebuilt (67 pages, 145.8 KB). Exit: 60/60 validator pages 0 issues, 0 broken links.

- **2026-05-26 — Responsive viewport QA & CSS audit (Task #1).** `assets/docs/LIVE_SITE_EVALUATION_2026-05-26.md` written. Real browser testing via Playwright Chromium (libgbm.so.1 stub + 21 Nix deps) across 26 pages × 8 viewports = 208 combinations. Results: 0 P0 defects, 2 P1 found+fixed, 1 P2 fixed. CSS fixes in `theme.css` (GLOBAL scope): (1) `.grid > * { min-width: 0 }` — ecosystem/ article.card overflow at 320–1024px fixed (classic grid min-width:auto bug); (2) `pre:not(.mermaid) { overflow-x: auto; max-width: 100%; }` — bare `<pre>` blocks scroll on narrow viewports; (3) `flex-wrap: wrap` + `@media (max-width: 480px)` compact rule on `.site-specials` (sparkle banner). All four `scripts/*.py` validators updated to exclude `.pythonlibs` and `.cache`. New scripts: `scripts/responsive-audit.py` (static analysis), `scripts/viewport-qa.py` (Playwright spec), `scripts/run-viewport-qa.py` (self-contained runner). Browser QA report: `assets/audit/viewport-qa-2026-05-26.json`. Exit: 208/208 browser checks clean, 60/60 validator pages 0 issues.

- **2026-05-26 — Targeted repair session (2026-05-26 evaluation).** `SITE_AUDIT_2026-05-26.md` written to repo root. Fixes: homepage nav logo `href=""` repaired to `href="/"`; `about/index.html` `<title>` aligned to `og:title` (`About Glee & Jamie — …`); deprecated `meta-keywords` and `meta-revisit-after` stripped from all 60 pages via `scripts/remove-deprecated-meta.py`; `/toolbox/` added as second footer nav item on all 60 pages via `scripts/add-toolbox-to-footer.py`; `assets/data/sparkle.json` + `assets/js/sparkle-loader.js` created for single-source Sparkle banner management — `scripts/inject-sparkle-loader.py` wired `data-sparkle-link` + script tag into all 60 pages. Pre-existing from prior sessions (confirmed, no change needed): `color-scheme: light dark` on all pages, `viewport-fit=cover` on all pages, `position: fixed` on `.construction-overlay`, "Skip to main content" skip links, hamburger `aria-label` on all pages. Exit state: 60/60 pages 0 issues, 0 warnings.


- **2026-05-12 — Comprehensive 6-domain site audit.** `SITE_AUDIT_2026-05-12.md` written to repo root. New idempotent script `scripts/fix-audit-2026-05-12.py` (144 fixes across 59 pages). Fixes: `color-scheme` standardized to `light dark` on all 60 pages (was `dark light`/`dark`/`light`/missing on ~50 pages); `viewport-fit=cover` added to ~40 pages; `author` meta added to 25 pages; `og:site_name`, `twitter:description`, `twitter:image` added to 8 pages; `DOCTYPE` case normalized on `02c-present-hoarder`; "Today's Sparkle" banner added to 2 missing pages (`05f-neighborly-bazaar`, `search/`); 4 non-standard page titles corrected to canonical `— Glee&#8209;fully Personalizable Tools™ 🧰🌳` format; `sitemap.xml` lastmod dates updated to 2026-05-12. Exit state: 60/60 pages 0 issues, 0 warnings, 0 broken links. Open items: GA4 event tracking, 3 stub GPT URLs, security headers (requires hosting migration).
- **2026-05-03 — Final audit pass.** Visible breadcrumb on 57 inner pages (mirrors the JSON-LD `BreadcrumbList`); restored missing `<!DOCTYPE html>` on `02b-decor-detective`; added `feed.xml` (Atom, 49 entries), `humans.txt`, `/.well-known/security.txt`; bumped sitemap dates from 2026-04-07 to 2026-05-03; new validators `scripts/validate-site.py`, `scripts/audit-assets.py`, `scripts/check-links.py`, `scripts/inject-breadcrumb.py`, `scripts/generate-feed.py`; 5 new `AUDIT_*_2026-05-03.md` reports + machine-readable JSON in `audit/`. 60/60 pages validate clean (0 issues, 0 warnings, 0 broken internal links).
- **2026-05-02 — Dedicated `/search/` page.** Shareable, bookmarkable search results page with breadcrumb, JSON-LD `SearchAction`, no-JS directory fallback, dark-mode support. URL syncs as `?q=` for share/bookmark. Added to `sitemap.xml`. `search.js` extended with `attachInline()` API; on the dedicated page it skips the auto-modal and renders inline.
- **2026-05-02 — `site.webmanifest` fixed.** Was empty (`name:""`, wrong icon paths, white theme color). Now declares full brand identity, brand colors (`theme:#d35b2d`, `bg:#f6f2ee`), correct paths to all favicon variants, plus maskable purpose for Android.
- **2026-05-02 — Internal search engine.** Index builder + runtime + nav UI + ⌘K/`/` keybinds shipped on all 59 pages.
- **2026-05-02 — Canonical-URL SEO bug fixed.** 6 inner tool pages (`03b-menu-conductor`, `03c-wishful-tastes`, `03d-pantry-shopper`, `06a-care-check`, `06b-calm-keep`, `06c-snappy-count`) had `<link rel="canonical">` pointing to the homepage instead of themselves — discovered by the search-index validator. All 6 corrected to match their `og:url`. Indexer now fails loud if this regression recurs.
- **2026-05-02 — Spirited Journal page repaired.** Was missing `<!DOCTYPE html>` and `<head>` opening tag (skipped during initial indexing).
- **2026-04-11 — Replit App Theme exports.** `gleefully-replit-theme.json` + `gleefully-replit-theme-guide.md` covering Foundation, Actions, Forms (focus border `#d35b2d`), Containers (paper-system surfaces), Charts (5 retro-stripe colors).
